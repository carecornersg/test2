# CAS User Guide

Welcome to the CAS (Call Activation System) User Guide. This documentation will walk you through the complete process of setting up and using the CAS system.

## What is CAS?

The **Call Activation System (CAS)** is a case management and AA (Appropriate Adult) assignment system designed for Care Corner Singapore's AAYS scheme. CAS helps you:

- **Create Cases**: Quickly create cases when Investigation Officers call in

- **Smart Assignment**: Automatically broadcast to eligible AAs with weighted selection

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track case status and AA responses in real-time

- **Fair Distribution**: Ensure cases are fairly distributed among AAs

- **VPRMS Integration**: Sync with Salesforce VPRMS for AA profiles and case outcomes
